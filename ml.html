                    1. Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)<br>
                    <br>
                    Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that
                    can learn from data and improve performance over time without explicit programming. The core concept
                    of ML is based on algorithms that allow machines to identify patterns in data and make predictions
                    or decisions. In recent years, ML has gained immense popularity across industries, from finance and
                    healthcare to manufacturing and retail, due to its ability to automate decision-making and provide
                    data-driven insights. <br>
